                  href="https://review.firstround.com/how-to-build-an-invention-machine-6-lessons-that-powered-amazons-success#lesson-1-slow-down-to-innovate"

                contemplating and writing documents on how best to
                serve the customer. Amazon believes this
                <em>is</em> the fastest way to work—thinking deeply
                about what the customer needs before executing on that
                rigorously refined vision.
              </p>
              <p>
                Similarly, as a data scientist, though I solve
                problems via code, a lot of the work happens
                <em>before</em> writing any code. Such work takes the
                form of thinking and/via writing documents. This is
                especially so in Amazon, which is famous for its
                writing culture.

                I’ll start by sharing three documents I’ve written:
                one-pagers, design documents, and after action
                reviews. Then, I’ll reveal the framework I use to
                structure most of my writing, including this post. In
                the next post, we’ll discuss design docs.

              </h2>
              <p>
                I usually write three types of documents when
                building/operating a system. The first two help to get
                alignment and feedback; the last is used to
                reflect—all three assist with thinking deeply and
                improving outcomes.

                <strong>One-pagers:</strong> I use these to achieve
                alignment with business/product stakeholders. Also
                used as background memos for quarterly/yearly
                prioritization. In a single page, they should allow
                readers to quickly understand the problem, expected
                outcomes, proposed solution, and high-level approach.
                Extremely useful to reference when you’re deep in the
                weeds of a project, or encounter scope creep.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Design docs:</strong> I use these to get
                feedback from fellow scientists and engineers. They
                help identify design issues early in the process.
                Furthermore, you can iterate on design docs more
                rapidly than on systems, especially if said systems
                are already in production. It usually covers
                methodology and system design, and includes experiment
                results and technical benchmarks (if available).
              </p>
              <p>
                Design docs are more commonly seen in engineering
                projects; not so much for data science/machine
                learning. Nonetheless, I’ve found it invaluable for
                building better ML systems and products.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>After-action reviews:</strong> I use these to
                reflect after shipping a project, or after a major
                error. If it’s a project review, we cover what went
                well (and not so well), follow-up actions, and how to
                do better next time. It’s like a
                <a
                  href="/writing/what-i-love-about-scrum-for-data-science/#retrospectives-feedback-loop-for-improvement"

                  >scrum retrospective</a
                >, except with more time to think and written as a
                document. The knowledge can then be shared with other
                teams.
              </p>
              <p>
                If it’s an error review (e.g., the system goes down),
                we diagnose the root cause and identify follow-up
                actions to prevent reoccurrence. Nowhere do we blame
                individuals. The intent is to discuss what we can do
                better and share the (sometimes painful) lessons with
                the greater organization. Amazon calls these

                Writing framework: Why, What, How, (Who)
              </h2>
              <p>
                The Why-What-How framework is so simple that it sounds
                like a reading/writing lesson for first graders.
                Nonetheless, it guides most, if not all, of my work
                documents. My writing on this site also follows it
                (the other format being lists like
                <a
                  href="/writing/practical-guide-to-maintaining-machine-learning/"
                  target="_blank"
                  >this</a
                >
                and
                <a href="/writing/data-science-teams/" target="_blank"
                  >this</a
                >).
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Why:</strong> Start by explaining
                <em>Why</em> the document is important. This is often
                framed around the problem or opportunity we want to
                address, and the expected benefits. We might also
                answer the question of <em>Why now?</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                Think of this as the hook for your document. After
                reading the <em>Why</em>, readers should feel
                compelled to blaze through the rest of your doc (and
                hopefully commit to your proposal). In
                resource-strapped environments (e.g., start-ups), this
                section convinces decision-makers to invest resources
                into your idea.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, it’s critical that—after reading this
                section—your audience understands the problem and
                context. Describe it simply in their terms: customer
                benefits, business gains, productivity improvements.
                Contrast the two <em>Whys</em> below; which is better
                suited for a business audience?

                The first one might be a tad exaggerated, but I’ve
                seen <em>Whys</em> that start like that. 🤦‍♂️ It’s a
                great way to lose the audience from the get-go.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>What:</strong> After the audience is convinced
                we should solve the problem, share what a good
                solution looks like. What are the expected outcomes
                and ways to measure them?
              </p>
              <p>
                One way to frame <em>What</em> is via measures of
                success and constraints. Measures of success define
                what a good (or bad) solution looks like; constraints
                define what solutions can (and cannot) do. Together,
                they enable readers to evaluate and decide on
                proposals, make trade-offs, and provide feedback.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another way of framing <em>What</em> is via
                requirements. Business requirements specify the
                expected customer experience, uplift to business
                metrics (success measures), and budget (constraints).
                They might also be framed as product or functional
                requirements. Technical requirements specify
                throughput, latency, security, privacy, etc., usually
                as constraints.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>How:</strong> Finally, explain
                <em>How</em> you’ll achieve the <em>Why</em> and
                <em>What</em>. This includes methodology, high-level
                design, tech decisions, etc. It’s also useful to add
                how you’re <em>not</em> implementing it (i.e., out of
                scope).
              </p>

                The depth of this section depends on the document. For
                one-pagers, it could be a paragraph or two on
                deliverables, with details in the appendix. For design
                docs, you may want to include a
                <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_context_diagram"

                  >system context diagram</a
                >, tech decisions (e.g., centralized vs. distributed,
                EC2 vs. EMR vs. SageMaker), offline experiment results
                (e.g., hit rate, nDCG), and benchmarks (e.g.,
                throughput, latency, instance count).
              </p>
              <p>
                Having a solid <em>Why</em> and <em>What</em> provides
                context and makes this section easier to write. It
                also makes it easier for readers to evaluate and give
                feedback on your idea. Conversely, poorly articulated
                intent and requirements make it difficult to spot a
                good solution even when it’s in front of us.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>(Who):</strong> While writing docs, we should
                keep our audience in mind. Although <em>Who</em> may
                not show up as a section in the doc, it’ll influence
                how it turns out (topics, depth, language).
              </p>
              <p>
                A document for business leaders will (and should!)
                look very different from a document for engineers.
                Different audiences will focus on different aspects:
                customer pain points, business outcomes, ROI vs.
                technical requirements, design choices, API
                specifications.
              </p>
              <p>
                Writing with your <em>Who</em> in mind makes for more
                productive discussions and feedback. We don’t ask
                business leaders for feedback on infra choices, and we
                don’t ask devops engineers for guidance on business
                strategy.

                <strong>Why:</strong> Our data science team (in an
                e-commerce company) is challenged to help customers
                discover products easier. Senior leaders hypothesize
                that better product discovery will improve customer
                engagement and business outcomes.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>What:</strong> First-order metrics are
                engagement (e.g., CTR) and revenue (e.g., conversion,
                revenue per session). Second-order metrics include app
                usage (e.g., daily active users) and retention (e.g.,
                monthly active users). Constraints are set via a
                budget and timeline.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>How:</strong> The team considered several
                online (e.g., search, recommendations) and offline
                (e.g., targeted emails, push notifications)
                approaches. Their analysis showed the majority of
                customer activity occurs on product pages. Thus, an

                <strong>Why:</strong> Currently, our product pages
                lack a way for users to discover similar products. To
                address this, we are building an i2i recommender to
                improve product discoverability and customer
                engagement.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>What:</strong> Business requirements are
                similar to those specified in the one-pager, albeit
                with greater detail. We collaborated with the web and
                mobile app teams to define technical requirements such
                as throughput (&gt; 1,000 requests per second),
                latency (&lt;150ms at p99), and availability (99%
                uptime). Our constraints include cost (&lt;10% of
                revenue generated, with an absolute threshold) and
                integration points.

                pages for a period of time. This was discovered by
                category managers inspecting their products’
                discounts.

                The spike in traffic led to increased latency
                (&gt;150ms) when serving recommendations. The
                increased latency led to the recommender widget timing
                out—and not being shown—on product pages. While
                autoscaling was enabled, it hit the
                <a
                  href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-InstanceLimitExceeded-error/"

                >
                and could not scale beyond that. Though we conducted
                load tests at 3x normal traffic, these were
                insufficient as peak traffic was 30x normal traffic.
                In addition, it was not discovered earlier because our
                alarms didn’t account for results not being displayed.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>What:</strong> Customer experience was
                unaffected as product pages continued to load within
                expected latency. Nonetheless, not serving
                recommendations led to loss of expected revenue. Based
                on revenue attributed to the recommender during the
                rest of the day, the estimated loss is $x.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>How:</strong> We will take these follow-up
                actions to prevent a repeated incident and detect
                similar issues earlier. These are their respective
                owners.

              <p>
                Writing documents cost money. They take time to write,
                review, and iterate on—this is time that could have
                been spent on implementation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nonetheless, writing is a cheap way to ensure we
                <strong
                  >solve the right problems in the right way</strong
                >. They save money by helping teams avoid rabbit holes
                or building systems that aren’t used. They also help
                align stakeholders, improve initial ideas, and scale
                knowledge.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the problem is ambiguous, the proposed solution
                contentious, the effort required high (&gt; 3-6
                months), and/or consensus is required across multiple
                teams, starting with a document will save effort in
                the medium to long term.
              </p>
              <p>
                So before you start your next project, write a
                document using Why-What-How. Here’s more detail about

                    While starting AWS, before writing any code,
                    engineers spent 18 months writing documents on how
                    best to serve customers.<br /><br />Similarly,
                    before I build anything, I write docs. Here,
